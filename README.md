  - DEPARTURE

- **Text Processing Pipeline**:
  - Custom text cleaning and normalization
  - Time and date standardization
  - Pattern-based event extraction
  - TF-IDF vectorization
  - BERT-based classification

### Machine Learning Models
- **Rule-Based Classification** - Initial event classification using maritime domain-specific rules
- **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** - Baseline ML model with n-gram features
- **BERT Model** - Fine-tuned BERT model for improved context understanding
- **Timeline Extraction** - Automatic extraction and standardization of event timestamps

### Frontend Features
- **Interactive Dashboard** - Real-time event visualization and analysis
- **Document Processing** - Support for PDF and DOCX formats
- **Data Export** - JSON and CSV export capabilities
- **Responsive Design** - Built with React 18 and TailwindCSS

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Python 3.8+ (for NLP components)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Install Python requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch datasets pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🧠 NLP Pipeline Details

### Text Preprocessing
```python
def clean_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    # Time format standardization
    text = re.sub(r'\d{1,2}[:.]\d{2}(\s*(hrs|hr)?)?', 'TIME', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\d{3,4}\s*hrs?', 'TIME', text)
    # Date standardization
    text = re.sub(r'\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{2,4}', 'DATE', text)
    # Special character removal
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-z\s]', ' ', text)
    # Whitespace normalization
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()
    return text
```

### Event Classification Models

1. **Rule-Based Classifier**
   - Pattern matching for common maritime events
   - High precision for standard event descriptions
   - Serves as a fallback mechanism

2. **ML-Based Classification**
   - TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams
   - Logistic Regression with balanced class weights
   - Achieves >90% accuracy on standard SOF formats

3. **BERT Model**
   - Fine-tuned BERT-base-uncased
   - Handles complex context and variations
   - Superior performance on non-standard descriptions

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a synthetic SOF dataset (`synthetic_sof_dataset_large.csv`) containing:
- Raw event descriptions
- Timestamps
- Event types
- Vessel information
- Port details

Example event entry:
```json
{
  "voyage_id": 1,
  "raw_text": "03/04/2025 10:00 – Anchored at port limits",
  "clean_text": "anchored at port limits",
  "event_type": "ARRIVAL",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-03T10:00:00"
}
```

## 🧩 Adding Routes

To add new routes to the application, update the `Routes.jsx` file:

```jsx
import { useRoutes } from "react-router-dom";
import HomePage from "pages/HomePage";
import AboutPage from "pages/AboutPage";

const ProjectRoutes = () => {
  let element = useRoutes([
    { path: "/", element: <HomePage /> },
    { path: "/about", element: <AboutPage /> },
    // Add more routes as needed
  ]);

  return element;
};


## 🎨 Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration includes:

- Forms plugin for form styling
- Typography plugin for text styling
- Aspect ratio plugin for responsive elements
- Container queries for component-specific responsive design
- Fluid typography for responsive text
- Animation utilities

## 📱 Responsive Design

The app is built with responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.
